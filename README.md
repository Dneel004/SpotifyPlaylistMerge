Inspiration
We have been using Spotify for a few years now and we thought it was long overdue for there to be a merge option on Spotify.

What it does
Our merge option adds the contents of one playlist to another playlist.

How we built it
We used the Node Spotify web API to communicate with the Spotify API. We used HTML5 to create a web interface that communicated with our Node.js server to get the Spotify playlist data. Once we had the playlist data, we chose the two playlist we wanted to merge.

Challenges we ran into
In the beginning, we had trouble communicating to the Spotify API. We ran into a lot of formatted issues, trying to get it to look perfect.

What we learned
Some of us learned Javascript basics, others learned more advanced Javascript functions. We learned how to play to our strengths, and how to collaborate efficiently.

What's next for Spotify Playlist Merger
We are gonna add the option to merge more than 2 playlist at a time.
